My name is Gabor Bakos, I am currently an MSc Mathematical and Computational Finance student at the University of Oxford. 
I have recently finished my MSc thesis on Reinforcement Learning in the Algorithmic Trading Domain and will soon be graduating from Oxford. 
As an Undergraduate I had a cumulative grade of 91% in BSc Financial Mathematics from the University of Surrey.

## Random
Played in the Hungarian premier basketball league and got Blues Award at the University of Oxford. Love all types of sports, if I am not home you can probably find me at the library or at the nearest sports centre.

> Mathematics, referred as `the language of our universe`is perhaps mankind's greatest achievement. It is omnipresent and omnipotent, capable of predicting the weather, describing the event horizon of a black hole or modeling Financial markets.
