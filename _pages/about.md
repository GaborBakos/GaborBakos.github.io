## Projects

Here are some projects I have completed for my curricula, dissertation and for self-interest.

#### Current
 - Support Vector Machines: Gaussian kernel for SVM, parameter settings `Matlab`
 - Regularized Linear Regression and Bias v.s. Variance: regularized linear regression cost function, polinomial feature space, learnign curve `Matlab`
 - Neural Networks Learning: random initialised weights, neural network cost function `Matlab`

#### Previous
 - Benchmarked the Black-Scholes Cox-Ross-Rubinstein and Monte Carlo methods for pricing options `Python` `Matlab`
 - Greeks (finance): Calculated out all first, second and some thrid order Greeks and plotted them in a 3D surface `Matlab` `Python` 
 - Built algorithmic trading platform: used bollinger bands, $\mu$ reversion and simple moving average models `Python`
 - Multi-class Classifcation and Neural Networks: logistic regression cost function, one-vs-all multi-class classifier, neural network prediction `Matlab`
 - Logistic Regression: sigmoid function, cost function, logistic regression prediction `Matlab`
 - Linear Regressions: gradient descent method for multiple variables, normalisations `Matlab`
 - Time-Series forecasting: AR, MA, ARMA, ARIMA `R`
 - Binomial pricing model `Python`

## Random
Played in the Hungarian premier basketball league. Love all types of sports, if I am not home you can probably find me at the library or at the nearest sports centre.

> Mathematics ô€€€referred as `the language of our universe`is perhaps mankind's greatest achievement. It is omnipresent and omnipotent, capable of predicting the weather, describing the event horizon of a black hole or modeling Fnancial markets.
